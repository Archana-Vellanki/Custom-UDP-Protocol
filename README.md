# Custom UDP Protocol Project

## Overview
This repository showcases a custom UDP protocol implementation designed for reliable communication and network access control. The project consists of two program assignments, each addressing specific aspects of the protocol's functionality.
- **Reliable Data Transfer**: Part 1 focuses on ensuring reliable data transfer between a client and a server, incorporating packet sequencing, acknowledgment, and robust error handling.

- **Network Access Control**: Part 2 extends the protocol to facilitate access control for a cellular network. The server validates client requests against a subscriber database, granting or denying access based on specific criteria.

## Features
- **Custom UDP Protocol**: Ensures reliable data transfer and access control.
- **Packet Handling**: Includes packet sequencing, acknowledgment, and retransmission on timeouts.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and handles various errors during communication.
- **Access Control**: Verifies client requests against a subscriber database

## Usage
Clone the repository and Run the client and server components.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Archana-Vellanki/Custom-UDP-Protocol.git
cd Custom-UDP-Protocol
